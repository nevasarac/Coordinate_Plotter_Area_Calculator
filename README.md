# Coordinate_Plotter_Area_Calculator
 Retrieving coordinate values (x, y) from a web page accessed via a URL link provided through e-support.  Sequentially connecting the retrieved points to form a two-dimensional closed area shape.  Drawing the shape obtained from connecting the points and computing its surface area. The surface area value is then multiplied by 10 to obtain the reserve value of the resource. Both methods of calculating the surface area, either by counting the total number of unit squares covered by the shape or by mathematical area calculation, are viable options.
